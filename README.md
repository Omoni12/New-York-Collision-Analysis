# New-York-Collision-Analysis

## My first data analysis at [Edgeline Careers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/edgeline-careers/)

New York City Collision Analysis for the years 2021-2023


## Introduction
This analysis report has the following aims; to determine the total number of collisions, what borough has the most analysis, vehicles responsible for the most injured and make suggestions to reduce the number of collisions occurring.

The table contains data obtained from a csv file. There are 238422 rows and 19 columns and it was sourced from Maven Analytics, under the instruction of [Ganiyat Olajumoke Ajala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ganiyat-olajumoke-abe).

The questions to be answered by the analysis include:

-What is the total amount of collisions recorded in 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively?

-What vehicles were involved in accidents with the highest number of injured people recorded?

-What are the top 7 reasons for collisions?

-What are the least types of vehicles involved in accidents?

-When do accidents occur the most during the day?

## Tools
With the use of Microsoft Excel and Power Query Editor, the data was cleaned.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
Following this are the different cleaning techniques the data underwent;

-The contributing factor column was split in two, towards the uppermost left, with the slash ‘/’ as the delimiter. The second column from the split was suitably renamed to Other Factors.

-All duplicates were eradicated from the data.

-All blanks were filled with Not Specified.

-The Vehicle Type column had Not Reported in certain rows, in order to ensure uniformity the blanks in the column were edited to show Not Reported.


## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and Insight
With the use of Pivot Tables and Charts, the analysis was carried out to answer the given questions. The following consists of evidence of the analysis carried out with insights into the situation;

●What is the total number of collisions recorded in 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively? 

In 2021, New York City recorded a total number of 110546 accidents. Following this there was a decrease in the amount of accidents recorded as the total for 2022 was 103780. The decrease in accidents did not stop as 2023 has recorded 24095 accidents so far into the month of April.

N.B: A line chart was employed to appropriately track the decrease of accidents over the years.

●What vehicles were involved in accidents with the highest number of injured people recorded?

Passenger Vehicles have the highest number of people injured recorded with a total of 201,841 persons. Following this is Transport vehicles with 6,642 people injured, Taxi’s with 6,015 injured, Bicycles with 5,533 injured and Buses with 4,197 injured.

N.B: A bar chart was used to show a representation of the disparity between the number of accidents caused by different vehicles.


● What are the top 7 reasons for collisions?

In order of the highest ranked; driver inattention while driving, unspecified reasons,failure to yield right-of-way, following too closely to the vehicle in front, passing or lane usage improperly, passing too closely and unsafe speed are the most common reasons for accidents in New York through 2021 and 2023. Driver Inattention alone is responsible for 58,308 accidents in total while unsafe speed is responsible for 8,429 accidents. The decrease over the years in the number of accidents implies that the rules regarding road safety are being strictly observed to ensure accidents do not occur which should be commended.

N.B: A bar chart has been used to show a vivid representation of the total number of accidents caused by certain reasons. 

●What are the least types of vehicles involved in accidents?

Utility vehicles, fire services, limousines, unknown vehicles and other(open passenger) vehicles have been recorded to be less likely to be involved in accidents. Utility vehicles have been involved in 856 accidents over the years which is a low amount compared to other vehicles.

N.B: A bar chart has been used to accurately depict the different types of vehicles involved in the least accidents.

●When do accidents occur the most during the day?

Over the time span of three years, New York saw a record number of accidents between 14:00 p.m and 18:00 p.m. This can be as a result of rush hour traffic, with a lot of vehicles and pedestrians on the streets all distracted by various reasons. The highest number of accidents occurred around 16:00 p.m at 15,065 collisions.

N.B: A line chart has been used to properly document the gradual rise and fall in the number of accidents over several hours.

●What is the total amount of collisions recorded in the different boroughs?

Brooklyn has the highest record of accidents recorded at a whooping 76,416 collisions. Queens has a record of 63,751 accidents which isn’t a significant difference from Brooklyn. Staten Island has the lowest recorded number of accidents with a number of 11,568 collisions. The difference is staggering as Brooklyn is much more populated than Staten Island hence why they have a higher number of accidents occuring.

N.B: A bar chart was used to show the significant difference in the number of accidents which occurred in different boroughs.

## Recommendation
1.Population Control should be an aim to achieve as this can cut down the number of accidents that do occur in crowded boroughs.

2.Traffic regulations: the use of more stop signs, speed limit signs and crosswalks would go a long way to reducing the amount of speeding cars and vehicles involved in accidents. 

3.Proper division of lanes,not only for vehicles but also for motorists or pedestrians, will encourage vehicles to stay in their lanes without drifting. 

4.Installing more security cameras to capture license numbers of defaulters to ensure they receive fines, this will in turn encourage people to be more careful on the road.
